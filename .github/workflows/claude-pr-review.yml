          Review the changes in this pull request diff (this is the code that changed between the PR branch and the base branch) focusing on these areas:

          1. Code Quality & Best Practices
            - Are there any violations of common coding standards or patterns?
            - Is the code readable, maintainable, and properly organized?
            - Are variable/function names clear and descriptive?
            - Is there any duplicated code that could be refactored?

          2. Potential Bugs or Issues
            - Are there any logical errors or edge cases not handled?
            - Are null/undefined checks in place where needed?
            - Are there any type mismatches or incorrect assumptions?
            - Are error conditions properly handled?

          3. Performance Considerations
            - Are there any inefficient algorithms or data structures?
            - For frontend changes, are there unnecessary re-renders?
            - Could any operations be optimized or cached?

          4. Security Concerns
            - Is user input properly validated and sanitized?
            - Are there any exposed sensitive data or credentials?
            - Are API endpoints properly authenticated/authorized?
            - Are there any potential injection vulnerabilities?

          5. Test Coverage
            - Are the changes adequately tested?
            - Are edge cases covered in tests?
            - Do the tests actually verify the intended behavior?
            - Are there any untested code paths?

          Please provide constructive, specific feedback. For each issue found, explain why it's a problem and suggest how to fix it. Prioritize the most critical issues first.
